            <li>1 tsp minced ginger</li>
            <li>A few sprinkles ground black peppers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>OTHER CONDIMENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/8 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds or perilla seeds, grounded</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the pork bones in cold water for at least 1 hour (to get rid of any excess red liquid that looks like blood). Drain away the water. (If you can, try to change the water every 15 mins.)</li>
            <li>Place the bones into a large pot and add enough water to cover the bones, then boil it for about 10 minutes over medium high heat, covered. Drain away the water and rinse the bones in cold running water.</li>
            <li>In a large clean pot, place the bones and add the water (7 cups) and all ingredients from the “aromatic vegetables” section. Simmer it on medium to low heat for 1 hr 30 mins, covered.</li>
            <li>While the bone broth is simmering;
                (1) Put the potatoes in a separate pot and add enough water to cover them. Boil it over medium high heat until the potatoes are nearly cooked (about 90%). Drain away the water and set aside the potatoes until needed.
                (2) In a separate pot, add some water and the salt (1/8 tsp) and boil it. Once the water is rapidly boiling, parboil the napa cabbage for 1 to 2 mins. Drain away the water and cool down the leaves. Tear down each leaf length ways with your hands. (Or you can use a knife to cut them.)</li>
            <li>Sieve the broth (from step 3) through the strainer and catch the broth in a large bowl. Also, keep the pork bones but discard any boiled spices/vegetables. It should result in about just under 5 cups of broth.</li>
            <li>Transfer the broth into a clean pot, then add back the pork bones, potatoes, cabbage leaves, and the seasoning base into the pot. Boil over medium high heat until the potatoes cook completely (10 to 15 mins).</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining vegetables (mung bean sprouts, crown daisy leaves, perilla leaves, and green chilies) and the ground sesame seeds into the pot and boil further 1 to 2 mins until they soften. Serve warm with steamed rice.</li>
        </ol>
