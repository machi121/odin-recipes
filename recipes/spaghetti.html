    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and they're still tender and moist. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time.</p>
